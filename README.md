# Govtech Data Engineer Tech Challenge 2023

## Brief Overview
Greetings and welcome to Nixster's test submission! As there were 3 parts to this test, I decided to split them up into their own subfolders. For part 1 and part 2, make sure to cd into those folders before running any of the instructions found in their respective markdown files!

Thank you for reading, and may the odds be in anyone's favour.
